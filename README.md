## PyBank

This code provides an analysis of bank data read from a CSV using the csv and os libraries from python. Using a combination of basic arithmetic operations, as well as list indexing and slicing, I modify the data and write it back out to the final output file. This overall finds the greatest increases and decreases in profits.
